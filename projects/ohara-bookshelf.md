To add a touch of personalization, OHARA integrates with neural networks and real-world 
survey data to analyze users' emotions. By capturing facial expressions through a built-in 
camera feature, the platform can determine users' current emotional states and recommend 
books that align with their mood and emotional needs.
In a nutshell, OHARA is a comprehensive platform that aims to revolutionize the e-book 
reading experience. With its intuitive interface, personalized bookshelves, collaborative
